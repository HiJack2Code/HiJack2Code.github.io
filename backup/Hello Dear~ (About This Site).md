### On this page, I will explain a few things to you, including the purpose of this site and the kind of content I will share, so that your time here won’t be wasted.



> **About this site.**

```
This is a personal blog site hosted on GitHub.

Originally, the site was intended to record issues I encountered while learning Linux. However, as I grow older and gradually gain a deeper understanding of society and people, my reflections on the world have expanded. Therefore, the content here includes:
- Code
  - Linux
  - Networking
  - System Administration
- Language Exploration
  - English
  - 中文
  - 日本語
- Reflections on Life
  - Random Thoughts
  - Personal Life Records
  - My Views on the World
```
